## Coffee-shop

It's a simple app, which simulates working of a coffee shop.

## General info

This app is written using Java and it's stucture is based on decorator design pattern. 
If there was a need to add another kind of coffee or extra to the system, only changes needed would be:
 - add new Extra/Coffee class
 - add another if statement to addExtras method
 - Modify interface (add more choices to choice selectors)
 
I based my app on example in [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-basic-design-patterns-all-developers-need-to-know/) article about design petterns.
I designed it in Android studio because I didn't want it to be just another console app, but make it more interacive.

## Purpose 

It made this app to start getting to know design patterns.
